Update state structure for all forms
Change all address fields to State, City, ZipCode
add switch for seller or agent
Add auto complete for Address, state, zipcode, city
add call to database
Add improved validation for address, state, zipcode, city
Add improved validation for mls
Add improved validation for deed reference number
Validate deadlines against each other
Determine if getValues can be converted to a hook to conform to DRY
Increase slider with slightly and add more padding to left side of YES
Add Additional Header to each page with a Title for the Page
Change Tab display Icon and Name
Add google lookup by property address

This issue will require additional refactoring and is 
not currently worth the time: Remove additional buyer if all fields are empty
