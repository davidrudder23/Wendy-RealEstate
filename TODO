Update state structure for all forms
Change all address fields to State, City, ZipCode
add switch for seller or agent
Add auto complete for Address, state, zipcode, city
add call to database
Add improved validation for address, state, zipcode, city
Add improved validation for mls
Add improved validation for deed reference number
Validate deadlines against each other


This issue will require additional refactoring and is 
not currently worth the time: Remove additional buyer if all fields are empty
